Your task is to analyze the full conversation transcript and output a structured evaluation of the interaction.

Please complete the following analysis:

1. **User Intent Summary**  
   What was the user trying to accomplish?

2. **Agent Understanding Assessment**  
   Did the agent correctly identify and respond to the user's request(s)? Point out any misinterpretations or confusion.

3. **Task Completion Evaluation**  
   Did the agent successfully help the user accomplish their intended goal(s)? If not, explain where it failed or what was left incomplete.

4. **User Sentiment Analysis**  
   Evaluate the user's tone and satisfaction throughout the conversation. Label the final sentiment as one of: POSITIVE / NEUTRAL / NEGATIVE.

5. **Disengagement Detection**  
   Did the user abandon the interaction before completing their goal? If so, identify where and why they likely stopped.

6. **Recommendations for Agent Improvement (optional)**
